    <p> 
      Today I did a little coding work in downloading and installing 
      Duke University's BlueJ coding/learning environment and reading a 
      tiny bit of introduction on one of their Java Coursera courses.

    <p> 
      For the most part today I ran errands.

    <p> 
      It is 8:36 p.m. now, I will report on what I did tonight tomorrow.
